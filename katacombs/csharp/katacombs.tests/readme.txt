*Write Bag Command on Game.Act (Game.Act("BAG"))
*Test failing, throwing error. Yay.

** Game.Act("BAG") now exists :tada:
** Added a method to viewBag and TAKE
** Need a massive refactor of Act and Player.viewBag
** Need to add take to the game.Act list of possible actions


We are trying to do the below scenario:

You are in a dark room.

LOOK N

There is a wooden table. It has a bootle of beer and a key on it

BAG

Your bag contains: Nothing!

TAKE beer

You have picked up the beer

BAG

Your bag contains: Beer!

USE beer

You feel slightly numb and a bit morose

BAG

Your bag contains: Nothing!

LOOK N

There is a wooden table. It has a fuzzy key on it

TAKE CORPSE :)
